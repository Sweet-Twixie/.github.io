# Football Player Position Prediction ⚽

Predicting which positions a football player can play—using data-driven insights from nearly **20,000 professional players**.  

Built to help **clubs, scouts, and analysts** identify versatile players, optimize squads, and make smarter recruitment and development decisions.

## Highlights
- **Python & scikit-learn** for modeling
- **Hierarchical multi-label classification**:
  - Broad roles: Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Forward
  - Specific positions within each role (except Goalkeeper)
- **Feature engineering & selection** on key skills: dribbling, pace, power, and more
- Tested with **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks**
- Evaluated using **F1-score (micro/macro)** & **Hamming loss**
